<h2> Graduation Speech by Oyeleye </h2>

	
<p> Now our watch ends…</p>

<p class="specialborder"> First of all, I would like to seek your forgiveness in advance, as I am about to pronounce some Finnish names. Enjoy my “Finnish accent” and kindly resist the urge to laugh. I will try my best. So help me God!</p>

<p> Please permit me to use this opportunity to thank the distinguished guests: Vice-Rector Riitta Pyykkö and Vice-Dean Jukka Husu, the representatives of the Faculty, students, parents, guidance, friends, children, distinguished ladies, gentlemen and my fellow graduates. My name is Oyeleye Oyedayo; a class of 2019 graduate of the LLEES master’s degree programme. Some years ago, just like yesterday, I gave my first valedictory speech, as school governor and best graduating student of my secondary school in Ojoo, Ibadan, Nigeria to a guest of about 300. Now I am here, 8,500km away talking to you beautiful people. This is indeed a dream. </p>

<p> Before I proceed, I would like to tell you all a very short story. The story is quite important, as it will give you a better picture of how emotional a day like this is for me, and how delighted I am to have graduated in this great citadel of learning, with some of the greatest minds in the world. It still feels like a dream, though. Somebody tap me!</p>

<p> Many years ago, a very young boy lost both of his parents on the same day to a tragic car accident at the age of 7. This was a major transition that woke him up to reality of life at a tender age. Regardless of the constraints, he rose up to the challenges to overcome the seemingly insurmountable obstacles. That boy was me. My parents emphasized how important education was, and would always encourage us- that is my brothers Oyelekan, Oyeleke and Oyelowo, and I. When it was about schooling, they gave us everything we needed. My parents loved education and used to tell us that if we performed excellently in school, they would make sure we studied in the best universities in the world. Here I am, an Ojoo boy graduating from this citadel with a combined degree, which means I also get a fancy certificate from the University of Regensburg, Germany. The award winning philosopher, 2pac Amaru Shakur will say, “if you make it through the night, there is a brighter day’. And mine is here. </p>

<p> Care for another story? Well, you will get it. In 2017, when tuition was introduced in Finnish universities, I applied to 7 master’s degree programmes, in 5 universities, and got accepted in all, with 5 full scholarships. That too was a dream. I chose LLEES due to the University of Turku world rank and the double degree option. After all my experience here through this programme, I now have a thousand and one reasons to choose it again, if I need to make another choice. Still today, I graduate from a world top 1% university. But there are other kids like my brothers and I in Africa, with so much ambition, passion and creativity. Most only require the opportunity to show themselves to the world. I hope I have represented them well, in my ways and words. Africa is full of greatness and talents. Talents in all fields being conquered by humankind- academics, robotics, literature, music, dance (gbe body e), physics among others.</p>

<p> The LLEES programme has availed my colleagues and I several opportunities and accessibilities to various educational institutions, materials and lots more. We have had internships in world class institutions. I had one of mine within the faculty, as an intern university teacher of Computer Supported Collaborative Learning (CSCL) course, under the mentorship of senior researcher Tarja-Riitta Hurme. One of the tasks was to organize teaching in a networked learning environment, within an international teaching network (University of Saarland, Germany; Open University of Netherlands, Netherlands; University of Oulu, Finland: and the University of Turku, Finland). I had the other internship at the Turku International School and Turun Normaalikoulu.</p>

<p> I have been a student representative, in the board of the international master’s degree programme, in LLEES, chaired by senior researcher Koen Veermans, during the academic year 2018 - 2019. Some of the tasks of the boards are to prepare application procedures and admission criteria, to make proposal of the number of the students to be selected, to plan curricula and prepare application and admission criteria in cooperation with international partners. Being on this board has also made me realize how rigorous and competitive the admission process is. Hence, the fact that we are all here today already shows we are winners. It proves we have what it takes to face the world and conquer it. To forge brilliant careers, build businesses, define industries and change the course of life as we know it. We have been armed with a very potent tool. It is left to us how we use it. I bet 1, 10, 50 years from now, I will look around the world and be even more proud that I have graduated as your colleagues and in a lot of cases, even friend.</p> 

<p> Earlier this week, Game of Throne ended, and today, school. What does one do with time now? Well, I suggest greatness.</p>

<p> Thank you for listening.</p>
